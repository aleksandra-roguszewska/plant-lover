# plant-lover
An app for houseplants enthusiasts - I just started it and it's currently on hiatus.

I'm going to start working on it again in second half of July. My plan is to use typescript and styled-components this time. I'll probably finish it sometime in August.

I did designs by myself using Figma: [Plant-lover-figma](https://www.figma.com/file/KkBybmH7Grv5gywuKa9XBX/plant_lover?type=design&node-id=15%3A2016&mode=design&t=V9dc1O9ZaRSkjoj2-1)
