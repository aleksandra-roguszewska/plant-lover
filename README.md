# plant-lover
An app for houseplants enthusiasts - I just started it and it's currently on hiatus.

I'm going to start working on it again in second half of July and probably finish it sometime in August. My plan is to restart it completely and use typescript and styled-components.

I did designs by myself using Figma: [Plant-lover-figma](https://www.figma.com/file/KkBybmH7Grv5gywuKa9XBX/plant_lover?type=design&node-id=15%3A2016&mode=design&t=V9dc1O9ZaRSkjoj2-1)
